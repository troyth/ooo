#Notes from Graham Harman Texts

###_The Quadruple Object_

> Recall that the sensual is what exists only in relation to the perceiver, and that the real is whatever withdraws from that relation. But if we consider a real hammer, it is not just withdrawn from any relation that other entities might have with it. The hammer is also _composed_ of relations between its component objects. (110)

> It is not enough to think of an object as existing in two forms: first in itself, and second as it appears in any relation. Instead, the object is a walled island that differs from relations in both directions. (111)

> Given that an object must inherently be a unity, its multitude of qualities can only arise from the plurality of its pieces. Thus this is no object without pieces, and an infinite regress occurs. (112)

> Human consciousness does not transcend the cosmos and observe it from a neutral scientific void, but forever burrows through an intermediate layer of reality, no more aware of the larger objects to which it belongs than of the tool-beings that withdraw from it. (114)

Objects have relations in two axes: vertical and horizontal. Vertical relations are those pieces that make up an object, the smaller components that aggregate into the object. Horizontal relations are relations to other objects in the world.

__Real objects only have vertical relations. Sensual objects only have horizontal relations.__
