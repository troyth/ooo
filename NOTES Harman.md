#Notes from Graham Harman Texts

###_The Quadruple Object_

######Objects

> For the purposes of this book, an object is anything that has a unified reality that is autonomous from its wider context and also from its own pieces. (116)

> _any relation immediately generates a new object_ (116)

> If certain components are arranged in such a manner as to give rise to a thing that exceeds them, in such a way that it can withstand certain changes in these components, then they have entered a genuine relation with each other as real objects rather than merely stroking on another's sensual facades. (116)

> Insofar as we somehow connect with a real object outside us, giving rise to perceptions of sensual tress, mailboxes, or blackbirds, we have somehow linked with that object to form a new real object... But if my relation with a tree forms a new object, then I as a real piece of that object find myself on its interior, confronting the mere image of the other piece. Thus we find an asymmetry on the interior of the object, between the real me and the sensual tree. The duality is inescapable: there is always a non-transitive contact in which a real object caresses merely sensual ones. If the tree relates to me as well, this must happen on the interior of a separate but related object. The usual mistake lies in obeying the Taxonomic Fallacy - the assumption that this asymmetry results from the intersection between two different _kinds_ of entities. (116-7)

> Hence, the true duality is not between minds and bodies, but between real and sensual objects. (117-8)

This illustrates the formation of an object. Objects can be formed from:
*	pulling from an API that connects to a database of static content (eg. tumblr posts, tweets, etc)
*	dissecting another object, pulling out key components (such as quotes, images, videos, tags, etc)
*	combining multiple objects
*	pulling from a live streaming API of sensor flow data (eg. temperature sensor, light sensor, video stream, etc)

######Object Relations

> Recall that the sensual is what exists only in relation to the perceiver, and that the real is whatever withdraws from that relation. But if we consider a real hammer, it is not just withdrawn from any relation that other entities might have with it. The hammer is also _composed_ of relations between its component objects. (110)

> It is not enough to think of an object as existing in two forms: first in itself, and second as it appears in any relation. Instead, the object is a walled island that differs from relations in both directions. (111)

> Given that an object must inherently be a unity, its multitude of qualities can only arise from the plurality of its pieces. Thus this is no object without pieces, and an infinite regress occurs. (112)

> Human consciousness does not transcend the cosmos and observe it from a neutral scientific void, but forever burrows through an intermediate layer of reality, no more aware of the larger objects to which it belongs than of the tool-beings that withdraw from it. (114)

Objects have relations in two axes: vertical and horizontal. Vertical relations are those pieces that make up an object, the smaller components that aggregate into the object. Horizontal relations are relations to other objects in the world.

#####Terms

__Taxonomic Fallacy__
Wrongly ascribing two different ontological structures to two separate _kinds_ of beings. Harman prefers that everything is just an object, which avoids correlationism.
